# 📋 Task Tracker App

The Task Tracker App is a mobile application built with React Native that allows users to easily create, manage, and complete daily tasks. The main goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, fast, and offline-capable task manager that helps users stay productive.

Unlike many heavy task management apps, this one focuses on simplicity and usability. Users can:
Add tasks: Enter task details quickly with a clean input form.
Mark tasks as completed: Tap to mark tasks as done and keep track of progress.
Persist tasks: All tasks are stored locally on the device using AsyncStorage, so they remain available even after restarting the app.
Minimal & distraction-free UI: Designed for users who want a clutter-free task manager.

The app is a great starter project for anyone learning React Native, as it covers:
- Handling state with React hooks
- Using AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Designing clean UI with React Native components
- Structuring a small-scale mobile app

This project can be further extended with features such as reminders, categories, due dates, and cloud sync.
